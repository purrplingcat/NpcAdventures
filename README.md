For some NPCs listed above we're missing companion dialogues. You can help us and you can create it. How? Fork this repo and see [Dialogue wiki](https://github.com/purrplingcat/PurrplingMod/wiki/Dialogues). You can get inspiration [from code](https://github.com/purrplingcat/PurrplingMod/tree/master/PurrplingMod/assets/Dialogue). Are you created dialogues? Just send us a PR.

### Adventure mode

By default this mod is played in adventure mode. This mode brings quests and events to interaction with your companions. For enable companion asking you must reach **20 level of mines**, have granted access to **Adventurer's guild** and received **letter from Marlon with invitation** and seen **Adventure begins** event with Marlon. Then you can ask villagers to companion. Marlon's letter you will receive morning when you reached **level 20, you have a 66% (3 hearts for default level 5 required hearts) of required heart level with any recruitable villager and you have an access to Adventurer's guild.** You already reached level and you have access and you installed/updated this mod? You will receive letter morning immediately (must to go out from FarmHouse to receive it tomorrow).

### Classic mode

Worried about adventure mode? Do you want old companion functionality like was in alpha versions? Don't be sad, just **disable adventure mode** in [configuration](docs/guide/configuration.md). By disabling adventure mode you disable also all quest lines and companion events!

### Custom NPCs

You can add your custom NPC as companion to this mod via content pack. See [documentation](https://github.com/purrplingcat/PurrplingMod/wiki/Content-packs)

## Compatibility

### Note for Android users

Beginning with version *0.11.0* there's an experimental support for Android SMAPI and Stardew Valley. There is list of known android issues:

- **HUD may be drawn at an incorrect position on some devices.** - If you have this problem, you can disable the HUD in configuration file. (Set `ShowHUD` to `false`)
- **The game may crash on Android 5.1 and older** - Can't fix it, because it's caused by SMAPI. Android SMAPI has an experimental harmony patching, you can report these crashes to @MartyrPher (developer of SMAPI for Android). Remember Android 5.1 and older is not officialy supported by this mod.

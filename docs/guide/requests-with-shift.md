# Requests with shift key

Due to conflicts with some mods will be added a choice to request (ask) a companion for recruit with a request *shift* key. You can enable this option in [configuration](configuration.md).

## Setup

In the `config.json` allow requests with shift key and you can optionaly to change a shift key binding. By default is used `LeftShift`.

## How to use

If you are eligible to recruit a companion and you want to do it, hold the *shift* key (`LeftShift` by default) and press action button (`RightClick` by default on PC). You must still hold the shift key while this action. If you did it in the right way, you got a request dialogue for recruit.
If you recruited and want any request for your companion (save items to bag or dismiss them) you must use the *shift* key too.

## Disable shift key

If you don't want to ask for follow with a *shift* key, you can disable it. You can do it in [configuration](configuration.md). Just switch off request key option (set it to `false`).
